# NMSM Pipeline Tutorial (work in progress)

## Introduction

This directory is the first step in the NMSM Pipeline Tutorial and is used to introduce the problem of interest and data provided as well as some of the structure of the tutorial.

### Prompt

You are a biomechanics analyst for a famous English Premier League soccer team. Your teams (expensive) star player is not performing as well as the team was hoping and you have been tasked to help design a plan to improve his performance.

One specific area on concern is that his free kicks seem weaker than previous years. You know that the speed of the player's foot at the time of contact with the ball is the largest indicator of ball speed.

**Task:** Design a program to strengthen our star player's muscles such that their foot velocity at contact is maximally increased.

The coaching staff is worried about the player being over-worked, thus they are limiting you to only increase his strength by *100N* distributed across any muscles in his dominant leg.

### Tutorial Structure

The nmsm-tutorial repository is broken into sections based on use of specific tools or sub-tools to achieve a specific task towards our final goal of saving the career of our star player and our own jobs in the process.

*Each step in the tutorial will contain all of the data needed to complete that step.* If you run out of time or there is an issue with your computation, you can move on to the next step and use the pre-computed data.

If you feel comfortable with particular tools in the NMSM Pipeline, feel free to skip or move past them and pick up with the tools you are interested in learning.
