# NMSM Pipeline Tutorial

## Tutorial Structure

The nmsm-tutorial repository is broken into sections based on use of specific tools or sub-tools.

*Each step in the tutorial will contain all of the data needed to complete that step.* If you run out of time or there is an issue with your computation, you can move on to the next step and use the pre-computed data.

If you feel comfortable with particular tools in the NMSM Pipeline, feel free to skip or move past them and pick up with the tools you are interested in learning.
